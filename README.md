# E-commerce SPA (Single Page Application)

This project is an e-commerce Single Page Application (SPA) for a physical store that sells household equipment from Siemens and Bosch. It is a front-end mock-up with no backend implementation, focusing on front-end functionalities.

## Overview

The e-commerce SPA project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing household equipment from Siemens and Bosch. The application offers various features to enhance the shopping experience, such as product filtering, detailed product views, and user registration. Please note the following details about the project:

1. **No Authentication or Authorization:** The application does not require authentication or authorization. Users can browse products, apply filters, view product details, and simulate a registration process without logging in or managing user roles.

2. **No Backend Implementation:** All functionalities are implemented on the front-end, with no server-side implementation. Data manipulation, such as filters and user registration, is handled locally within the application.

3. **Stubbed API Calls:** In the absence of a backend, API calls made by the application are stubbed. This means simulating actual API behavior by returning pre-defined data. Libraries like json-server or MirageJS can be used to create a fake server within the application.

4. **Key Features:** Despite the lack of a backend, the application implements the following key features on the front-end:
   - Product Overview
   - Product Filter
   - Product Details
   - User Registration
   - Password Confirmation
   - Password Security
   - Input Validation
